bugs - name attribute for attempt isnt complete 
-all of a sudden the delete function isnt working thats annoying -fixed
-when using flexbox column on graph it shifts everything else
-when I hit the all atempts for a particular challenge it will keep duplicating
maybe a theres a way to add a conditional statement or something to an event listener(need to look up how to do this or just switch to showing all attempts in column)
To Do
- copy spec.md checklist and start checking off requirements
- add color to graph
- add "done" button to attempt so that once click it sends a patch request to the attempt which changes the complete attribute  to true so that it will update the graph of that challenge and show how many attempts are complete
- think of more features to add
-make sure code follows convention and is as dry as possible by reviewing with instructor
- find a way to syle the webpage, look at examples and find a way to make it look good but not distracting 
-don't get complacent, keep improving app and review material and make sure you can communicate your code and the concepts,FOLLOW THE DATA!
