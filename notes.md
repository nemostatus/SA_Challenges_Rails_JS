dynamic helper who changes the more  attempts are complete for a certain challenge
so domcontentloaded should render the normal sprite
depending on how many attempts are completed for a given challenge changes the sprite
what to do?
start by learning how to add  sprite into your app via appending from index.js
if you can do that you can build the sprite helper
