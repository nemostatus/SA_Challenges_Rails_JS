[x] Well-named variables and methods
[x] Short, single-purpose methods
Git
[x] Aim for a large number of small commits - commit frequently!
[x] Add meaningful messages to your commits. When you look back at your commits with git log, the messages should describe each change.
[x] Don't include changes in a commit that aren't related to the commit message
