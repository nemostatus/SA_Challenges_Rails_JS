Description: this app is using rails as an API (backend) and using Javascript as the frontend. The goal for the application is going to be helping anyone who struggles with social anxiety. The application will give the user the ability to create a social interaction challenge for themselves or others ranging in difficulty(e.g. Say "hello" to a stranger(difficulty level: 1) or Performing at an open mic comedy club (difficulty level: 10). The app will format these challenges based on difficulty and will encourage the user to slowly interact socially with others. This app will be loosely based off the exposure therapy model. THIS APP IS NOT A SUBSTITUTE FOR PROFESSIONAL MENTAL HELP. It is for anyone who wants to break out of their shell and slowly shift their comfort zone. )
